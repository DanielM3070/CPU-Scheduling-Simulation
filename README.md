File(s) included: 
- Main.java - includes all scheduling classes and simulation methods
- <Schedule>.sf - Scheduling file: Specifies schedulingn algorithm
- <Process>.pf - Process file: Specifies processes information

How to compile and run: 
- First to compile: javac Main.java

Then to run: 
- Java Main <algorithm>.sf <processFile>.pf

<algorithm> - The Schedule File Name, for example fcfs
<ProcessFile> - The process file, for example simple

Combined, will look like this for example: 
- Java Main fcfs.sf simple.pf
